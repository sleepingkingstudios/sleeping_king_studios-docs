  - 'yields': The block yielded by the method.
  - 'yieldparams': The yielded blocks' parameters.
  - 'yieldreturn': The value returned by the block.

  Finally, the method may have one or more overloads, which replace or
  supplement the method with alternative signatures or documentation.

  - 'overloads': The method overloads, if any. Each overload has the same
    keys as a full method object.
